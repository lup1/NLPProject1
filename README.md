"alphabet.txt" gives the vocabulary of the finite state machine. Next, "startState.txt" gives the starting state of the finite state machine, and "states.txt" gives all of the states that the finite state machine could go through. Finally, "finalState.txt" gives the accepting state of the finite state machine. "transitionTable.txt" gives the inputs that would cause the finite state machine to change states.

To run the program, you would compile the program using "g++ project1.cpp" and then run it by typing "./a.exe" into the command line. When prompted, type in the string that you wish to test. The string that would be accepted by the finite state machine using the current vocabulary is "bruh?". By default, the documents used to create the vocabulary and states gone through by the finite state machine are programmed into the code itself. To run the program using different vocabularies and/or states, one would need to replace the documents used.
